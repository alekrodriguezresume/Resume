# Aleksander R. Rodriguez Kozlowski | Interactive Resume

Welcome to my personal resume website. I built this site to give a quick, professional overview of who I am, what I’ve done, and what I can offer.

I'm a detail-focused professional with experience in program analysis, quality management, and government records tracking. I enjoy solving problems, building systems that work better, and learning new tools that make life easier. Whether it's leading a project, creating dashboards, or tuning engines — I get the job done.

This website shows some of my GitHub projects, and it's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It automatically updates to show the latest work from my GitHub account.
