# Personal Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal website. The site is built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and includes:

- A responsive navigation bar
- Hero section with stock imagery
- About section with a short bio
- Project gallery with links to GitHub repositories
- Contact form powered by Formspree

My resume is available directly from the site and can be found in this repository as `Aleksander Rodriguez_Resume V1.pdf`.

To view the website locally, open `index.html` in a web browser. For a live version, you can publish the site with GitHub Pages.

Feel free to clone this repo and adapt it for your own portfolio.
